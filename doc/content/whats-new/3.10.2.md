### Changed

- Log field consistency for HTTP and gRPC request logs.

### Fixed

- Uplink frame counter reset handling.
- Uplink retransmission handling in Network Server.
- DevAddr generation for NetID Type 3 and 4, according to errata.
- Packet Broker downlink in multi-tenant clusters.
- HTTP header propagation (such as Request ID) to gRPC services.
